# 🚀 Day-10 Node.js Onboarding
### 🌍 Running a Web Application
- If you are creating web apps, to run a web app you need atleast 2 computer.
    1. Client (User's computer) - The machine where the user opens the browser and interacts with the app.
    2. Server (Hosting Machine) – A powerful computer with 24×7 electricity and high-speed internet, responsible for handling client requests.

- 👉 Keeping code on a server so it can be accessed worldwide is called Web Hosting / Website Hosting / Deployment.

### 📈 Traffic
- **100k traffic** : means 100k total users visiting the website.
- **100k concurrent traffic** : 100,000 users accessing the website at the same time (per second).
### 🔄 Request & Response
- **Request :** When a user performs an action (e.g., typing in search bar and pressing Enter) is called request.

- **Response :** The data/resource the server sends back to the client for that request is called response.

### ⚡ Latency 
- The total time taken for a request to reach the server and for the response to come back.

- **Low Latency**:  Faster loading and better user experience.
- **Best Practice**: For landing pages, latency should be 3s to 5s maximum.


### 👩🏼‍💻 Client-side & Server-side Language 
- **Client-side :** The language which runs on client's computer (browser) is called client side language. ex - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VBScript(outdated).
- **Server-side :** The language which runs on server is called server-side language. ex - Node.js, php, Laravel, CodeIgnitor, Java, python, c++, .Net, C#.
